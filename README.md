# Sorry folks. netconfd is discontinued.

It's not as bad as it sounds. I found I was never really devoting any significant work to it, constantly frustrated with not having enough of it working to be useful, and the data model was always painfully vague. So netconfd itself is no longer a thing. But it's not the end of the line for its planned features.

See, I wouldn't just dump this kind of project for those reasons alone, I try to finish my stuff these days. The primary motivation is the existence of [Plinth](https://github.com/jvasile/Plinth), which has the same goals, but a much wider audience, and will be use in Freedombox. So rather than support fragmentation and duplicate effort, I'm going to devote my effort to improving and developing Plinth. This means, among other things, making a branding-neutral fork, so that non-Freedombox projects like my own Roaming Initiative systems (or Byzantine Linux) can use it as well, though obviously that's one of the most superficial changes I have planned.

In short, the shop's boarded up, but the groceries and cashiers are just across the street now. And honestly, the new digs already look nicer and more professional than anything I can do, so I'm looking forward to working there :)
